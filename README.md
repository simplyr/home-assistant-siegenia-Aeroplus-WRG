# Siegenia for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration to control and monitor Siegenia Aeroplus WRG smart ventilation devices with Co2 sensor.
Vibe coded, based on the awesome work for iobroker here: https://github.com/Apollon77/ioBroker.siegenia 

Tested with 4 Aeroplus WRG modules. Other siegenia devices might work, untested.

## Features

### Core Features
- Local control via WebSocket connection (no cloud dependency)
- Real-time updates through push notifications + polling (10s interval)
- SSL support with configurable port (default: 443)

### Available Entities

#### Fan Control
- **Siegenia Fan**: Control fan power and on/off state
  - Supports percentage-based control (0-100%)
  - 100% maps to device's maximum airflow capacity
  - Respects manual airflow cap settings
  - Features: Turn On/Off, Set Speed/Percentage

#### Numeric Control
- **Siegenia Fan Power**: Direct airflow control in m³/h
  - Auto-adjusts to device's maximum capacity
  - Takes into account manual power limitations

#### Mode Control
- **Siegenia Auto Mode** (Switch): Toggle automatic operation mode

#### Sensors
- Temperature (Incoming/Outgoing air) in °C
- Humidity (Incoming/Outgoing air) in %
- CO₂ Level (ppm, `airquality.co2content` when available)
- Air Quality
- Maximum Fan Power
- Manual Fan Power Cap
- System Name
- Connection Status
- **Siegenia Online** (Binary Sensor): WebSocket connection status
- **Siegenia Raw State**: Diagnostic sensor showing complete device state

- Maintains persistent connection with heartbeat (10s interval)
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- SSL support with self-signed certificate handling

### Update Methods
- Push updates through WebSocket for immediate state changes
- Polling every 10 seconds as fallback
- Coordinator pattern for efficient state management

### Device Control
- Direct parameter control via WebSocket API
- Support for various device parameters and modes
- Automatic state synchronization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Failures**
   - Verify device IP address and port
   - Check credentials
   - Ensure device is on the same network
   - Verify SSL settings match device configuration

2. **State Updates**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify WebSocket connection status via Online sensor
   - Review Home Assistant logs for error messages
